The idea is to bring together all interested parties to help ban firework sales to private citizens. Be a repository for information to help citizens get legislation introduced to ban the sale of fireworks in their state.



### WHY?

I am glad you asked, there are actualy very good reasons for this:



1. The sudden and loud noises are a constant source of agitation for our veterans with PTSD.

2. Many wild and domestic animals are driven into a flight state and have injured themselves trying to flee the noise.

3. The World Health organization is concerned that the noise is over 120 decibels, that is considered the pain threshold for humans and also lead to permanent hearing loss.

4. Lead and other chemicals released into the air, cause breathing difficulties for individuals with asthma,COPD, lung cancer etc. As well as the polution it creates.

5. The death and injuries resulting from fireworks. As many as 9,000 injuries show up in the Emergency Room. As many as 400 cases of blindness each year.

6. On the 4th of July, many areas are under a high fire danger warning. The loss of personal property and wildlands that are a refuge for animals .

7. Most places where fireworks are used, it is actually illegal to use or sometimes posess the fireworks. This wastes millions of tax payer dollars and police resources that could be put to better use. Let's face it, citizens can no longer be trusted to do the right thing.
